Creating a project to implement an affine cipher in Java involves designing a program that can encrypt and decrypt messages 
using the affine cipher algorithm. The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, 
where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function,
and converted back to a letter.
